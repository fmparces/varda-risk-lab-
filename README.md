Varda: Financial Risk Lab

Varda is a financial risk lab that uses physics-inspired models,
Monte Carlo simulation, and network analytics to visualize how credit and
systemic risk propagate through real-world relationships.

Core Capabilities:
- Fluid dynamics metaphors and network models for risk propagation
- Monte Carlo simulations for scenario analysis
- Markov chain models for state transitions (credit ratings, risk states)
- AI predictors for risk forecasting
- Credit and systemic risk analytics
- Network-based visualization of risk flow across relationships
  (borrowers, lenders, suppliers, etc.)
